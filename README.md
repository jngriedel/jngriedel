For years coding was my favorite part of school and work, and now I can make it every part! 

I'm a software engineer trained in Javascript, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Express, React, Redux, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, and more. I love learning new technologies and using them immediately to solve problems or build creative and useful apps and projects, as well as helping others and debugging.

I'm looking to apply my skills in a fast-paced environment, learning every day and consistently using that new knowledge to solidify my skills and contribute to a project I believe in.

You'll also find me trying to make the people around me laugh, and settling for myself when my jokes bomb. I'll be here all week.
